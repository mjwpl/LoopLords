# Loop Lords

Loop Lords is an application designed to help users manage their recurring tasks efficiently. It aims to remind users of their cyclical tasks before the deadline, reward them for completing tasks within the cycle, prioritize tasks based on their last completion date (e.g., diet), and assist users in breaking habits (e.g., computer gaming addiction).
